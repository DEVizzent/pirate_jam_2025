ENDING\: DRAGON QUEEN.
As you sit in the throne, you realize that the egg you were given as a gift is now hatching.
A small cute dragon climbs out of it, and crawls around your ankles.
You spend your days feeding it, and once it's big enough, you bring it into battle.
It can now feed itself, so you just stride along as it blazes a path for you to finally be the queen you were born to be.
You and your dragon take the place in history that you deserve.
Rule Britannia!
