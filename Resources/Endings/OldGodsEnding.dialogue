Those Who Sleep start stirring, and the land is sundered as creatures start terrorizing the land.
Your subjects suffer in fear as their fields and houses become distorted and twisted.
The castle bends over itself in weird angles and impossible foldings, as hyperdimensional beings run amock.
Mostly, you remember the sounds, because they are the easiest things for your brain to understand.
The screaming, mostly yours, hunts your last seconds of live.
So when the creatures are satisfied and return to sleep, no one is there to see them leave.
Rule this barren lifeless rock floating through space!
