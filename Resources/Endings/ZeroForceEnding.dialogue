Chaos runs through the kingdom, as your last knight hangs their weapons and joins the looters.
Those who are not actively rioting, are pointing at you as the reason for the riots.
You do all your can to rally troops to your side, but in the end you get but one soldier by your side.
They're a young kid who knows no better, but they will help you resist the onslaught.
And then, as the door opens, the soldier realizes their mother is leading the riots.
So you are alone again.
The looters are good and you get to keep your life, but they remove all your dignity and power.
Rule Britannia!
