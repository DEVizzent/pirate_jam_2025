Finally, thanks to all your efforts, Britain is regarded as the most pious country in the world.
God and the Pope both now have your back, and the kingdom thrives thanks to it.
Your crops are bountiful, and your people devout.
Your churches and catherdrals are lauded, and your rule will be remember forever.
Rule Britannia!
