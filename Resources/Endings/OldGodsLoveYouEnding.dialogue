Those Who Sleep start stirring, and the land is sundered as creatures start terrorizing the land.
Your subjects suffer in fear as their fields and houses become distorted and twisted.
The castle bends over itself in weird angles and impossible foldings, as hyperdimensional beings run amock.
Mostly, you remember the sounds, because they are the easiest things for your brain to understand.
And then, they smile at you.
Your sanity broken, you wave them when they return to sleep.
Everyone is dead, and in aeons to come, you will wake with your new found friends.
Rule the void!
