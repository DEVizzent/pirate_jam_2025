ENDING\: CONQUERED BY FRANCE!
After the news reach you, you rally what little troops you have left.
You amass your army at Dover and wait, in the morning mist, for the ships to appear.
And then, as the flags start showing up, your men cower.
The flags start coming, and they don't stop coming.
Before you know it, the French walk into the throne room, and you are deposed.
Vive le Bretagne!
