ENDING\: FAITHLESS
Your subjects have fully rejected your faith.
You are the subject of mockery around the country, and your places of venerations are consistenly desecrated.
So when a massive flood washes away the infidels, you revel for a bit.
That is, until you realize all your subjects are gone.
Alone with a ghost kingdom, you sit in your throne and pray.
Maybe if you do it enough, someone will actually listen to you.
Rule Britannia!
