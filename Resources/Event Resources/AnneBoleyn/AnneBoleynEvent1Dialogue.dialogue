Being educated has it's perk for a ruler.
For example, Anne knows how to sing, and how to dance...
But she also knows how to make friends with other highly educated rulers.
Her contacts in France allow her to create a strong alliance, made not of forced marriage or shared struggles, but of shared strengths.
You never expected people skills to be part of a ruler's toolbox, but you are happily surprised.
