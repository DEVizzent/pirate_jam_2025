Once St. Augustine is on the throne, he and his advisors come together.
They can see that a lot of the land seems to be taken by useless stuff, like fields, buildings and nature.
So they make a plan to replace all that junk with proper good old churches and cathedrals.
Word of what you are building reaches Rome and other pious countries, and soon many come to Britain in pilgrimage.
The many relics they bring are a welcome addition to your treasures.
