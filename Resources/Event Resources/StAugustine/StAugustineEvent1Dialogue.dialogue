Once St. Augustine is on the throne, he and his advisors come together.
They can see that a lot of the land seems to be taken by useless stuff, like fields, buildings and nature.
So they make a plan to replace all that junk with proper good old churches and cathedrals.
This makes the people extra happy, as they can now go and pray to God to help them regain some of what they lost when their houses were reclaimed to build churches.
