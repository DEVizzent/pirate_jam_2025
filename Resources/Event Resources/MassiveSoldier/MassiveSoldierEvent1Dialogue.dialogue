The Massive Soldier sits on the throne, and instantly gets restless.
So they leave for Wales and conquer it.
Then, with their needs fullfilled, they sit back on the throne.
They instantly start twitching their legs and stimming.
Soon, they've left to conquer Scotland.
Then, they conquer Ireland (sort of).
Still restless, they now sit as ruler of a unified kingdom, and they set their eyes on the rest of the world!
