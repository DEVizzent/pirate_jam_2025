EVENT\: OH BRITAIN WHERE ARE THOU
Christians all around the world are busy trying to kill everyone who disagrees with them.
They are specially concerned about reclaiming a piece of land with some significance or the other.
Britain, as a land that understands that even gods are unimportant and temporary, is happily abstaining of all that.
But it turns out that Europe is a bit upset about that.
A strongly worded letter is sent to Morgana from Rome that reads 'BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE BESTIES'.
Morgana tosses the letter in the trash.
