EVENT\: THE BEST OMEN
Some farmers from the North have traveled all the way to Camelot to introduce their child to Morgana.
The reason for this is that the child has big, beautiful deer antlers on their head.
This is seen as an omen that the land is happy with Morgana, and people around the kingdom rejoice.
The child seems concerned with the attention they are getting, but their opinion is not really important here.
