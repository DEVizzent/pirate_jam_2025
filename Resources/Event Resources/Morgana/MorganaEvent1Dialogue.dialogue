EVENT\: WAIT NO
Wait.
This is not how the story goes.
You got it wrong.
Ehm...
Morgana sits at the throne.
She is...
Ah...
A witchy ruler?
Uhm, actually, it seems some people like her.
Her first years in the throne are bountiful.
People pray to the Gods of the Land, and they respond with good crops and fair weather.
Also, less people get murdered by knights for some reason.
