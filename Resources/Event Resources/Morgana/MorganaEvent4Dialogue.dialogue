EVENT\: DRAGGING ON
The court shakes when an old creature, wise and powerful, drops near Morgana.
Unfazed, she asks the dragon what it's business is.
The dragon mentions old debts and allegiances, and bows to Morgana.
She seems as surprised as everyone else, but gladly accepts the help, and makes the dragon a knight.
