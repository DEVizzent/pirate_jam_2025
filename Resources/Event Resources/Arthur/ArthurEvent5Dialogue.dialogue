EVENT\: HOLY S* IT'S THE HOLY GRAIL
The knights of the round table have been looking for this for a while now.
And their efforts have payed off, you now have one of the most prized relics of the faith stored in your treasure room.
How a cup used to drink on the other side of the world hundreds of years ago ended up in a charity shop in Croydon is not important.
As is the small 'Made in China' seal that someone forged into the very real Grail.
