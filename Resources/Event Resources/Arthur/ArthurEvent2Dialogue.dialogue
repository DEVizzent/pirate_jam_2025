EVENT\: MEET THE POPE
The Pope has come to meet the new ruler of Britain.
As the masses celebrate this faithful meeting, you see the court feasting.
You see the armies being emboldened, knowing they have the strength of the Church behind them.
Almost nobody notices that this isn't the actual Pope but just some guy you dressed up as him, because people don't usually travel to Rome.
So after Arthur kills him, the secret is safe, and the kingdom prospers!
