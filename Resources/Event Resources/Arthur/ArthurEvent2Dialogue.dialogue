The Pope has come to meet the new ruler of Britain.
As the masses celebrate this faithful meeting, your court feasts.
Your armies are now emboldened, knowing they have the strength of the Church behind them.
Almost nobody notices that this isn't the actual Pope but just some guy you dressed up as him, because people don't usually travel to Rome.
So after you kill him, the secret is safe, and the kingdom prospers!
