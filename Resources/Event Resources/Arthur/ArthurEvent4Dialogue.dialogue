EVENT\: DRAGONSLAYER
The knights of the round table are a proactive and entrepreneurial bunch.
They are always finding things to do and stuff to fight.
So when one of them comes to the court carrying the head of a dragon, everyone rejoices!
Everyone but the dragon and it's friends, of course, but who cares about the Fae?
Surely nothing bad will come from this...
