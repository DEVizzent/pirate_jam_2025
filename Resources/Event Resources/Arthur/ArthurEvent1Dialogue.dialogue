EVENT\: RULE BRITANNIA
Ah, the kingdom is unified again.
After Arthur Pendragon, son of Uther, claims the throne, as instructed by GOD (and a very handsome sword), the reign starts to flourish.
Peasants turn to their duties of collecting food for the army and knights that now roam the land searching for The Holy Grial.
And killing anyone who disagrees with them.
