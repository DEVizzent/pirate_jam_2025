EVENT\: FAE FRIENDS
As Merlin sits on the throne, something seems to concern him.
He is an old and wise man, and he remembers the debts and promises made long ago.
He summons the crows, and sends them with messages of friendship and collaboration.
A contract is drafted, and Merlin loses their immortality in favour of the immortality of the kingdom.
You are moved (in a figurative sense, you are still very much stuck in the shop).
