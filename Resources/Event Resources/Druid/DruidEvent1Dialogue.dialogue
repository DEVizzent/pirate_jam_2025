The Druid sits on the throne, and the Fae come.
For days, they are locked in tense negotiations.
The kingdom needs it's myths, but the myths need their kingdom.
It is hard to gauge how the neddle will drop, but the Druid remains sane and clear headed.
In the end, a price is paid, but the debt is gone.
Britain and Avalon are now equals.
