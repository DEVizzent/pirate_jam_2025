EVENT\: THE MIRACLE OF THE SPRING
A wandering preacher claims to have witnessed a miracle\: a barren spring suddenly flowing with fresh water.
The people flock to the site, and the Church declares it a sign of divine favor.
Faith in the kingdom's spiritual destiny grows, but the lack of a king to capitalize on this miracle leaves the army feeling neglected and forgotten.
