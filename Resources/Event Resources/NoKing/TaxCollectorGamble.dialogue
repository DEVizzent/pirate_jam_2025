EVENT\: THE TAX COLLECTOR'S GAMBLE

With no king to oversee the treasury, local tax collectors grow greedy and impose heavy taxes on the peasants.
The people, already struggling, rise up in protest and refuse to pay.
The army is too disorganized to enforce the taxes, and the collectors are forced to back down.
The people celebrate their small victory, but the kingdom's coffers remain empty.
