EVENT\: THE COUNCIL OF LORDS
With no king to lead, the noble lords of the realm gather to form a ruling council.
They attempt to maintain order, but their lack of unity weakens the kingdom's military.
Meanwhile, the Church steps in to fill the spiritual void, organizing grand sermons and processions to keep the people's faith strong.
However, the absence of a charismatic leader leaves the army demoralized and disorganized.
