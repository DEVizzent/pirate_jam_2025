EVENT\: THE BANDIT KING
In the absence of a strong ruler, bandits grow bold and begin raiding villages along the kingdom's borders.
The army, lacking a charismatic leader, struggles to mount an effective response.
The people lose faith in the kingdom's ability to protect them, and some even turn to the bandits for protection.
