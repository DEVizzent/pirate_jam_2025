Henry VIII sits on the throne with the gait of someone who believes themselves entitled to it.
His reign is convoluted, and he revels in being contrversial.
This reaches a peak when Rome demands a tithe, and Henry becomes quite upset.
In a decision that everybody hates, he declares himself head of the Church, and schisms as hard as any human has ever schismed.
Rome doesn't even understand what happened, the schism was so intense...
Anyway, your people are now protestants, and nothing really changed except everybody is slightly more pissed off.
